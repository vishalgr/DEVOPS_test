            <h3>WHAT IS DEVOPS?</h3>
            <p>
DevOps is a set of practices that works to automate and integrate the processes between software development and IT teams, so they can build, test, and release software faster and more reliably.The term DevOps was formed by combining the words “development” and “operations”. As its name suggests, it seeks to bridge the gap between development and operation teams, which historically functioned in siloes. The concept of DevOps was founded on building a culture of collaboration between teams that historically functioned in siloes.</p>

            <h3>HISTORY OF DEVOPS</h3>
            <p>The DevOps movement started to coalesce some time between 2007 and 2008, when IT operations and software development communities got vocal about what they felt was a fatal level of dysfunction in the industry.</p>
        <p>They railed against the traditional software development model, which called for those who write code to be organizationally and functionally apart from those who deploy and support that code.</p>    
        <p>Developers and IT/Ops professionals had separate (and often competing) objectives, separate department leadership, separate key performance indicators by which they were judged, and often worked on separate floors or even separate buildings. The result was siloed teams concerned only with their own fiefdoms, long hours, botched releases, and unhappy customers. Surely there’s a better way, they said. So the two communities got together and started talking – with people like Patrick Dubois, Gene Kim, and John Willis driving the conversation.</p>
